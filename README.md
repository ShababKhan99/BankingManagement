# BankingManagement

#This program mirrors a very basic banking system. It has three classes: The base class, Account, and the two subclasses, Checkings and Savings. This base class creates a regular banking account, however its main use is to be use in tandom with the subclasses, as the bank has either a checkings or savings. These classes vary slightly, especially in the minimum amount needed in the account at all times.
